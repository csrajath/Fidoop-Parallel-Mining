# Fidoop-Parallel-Mining
Implementation of two algorithms related to data-mining and association mining.

# Requirements
These are the list of softwares / tools required to build the project:
  1. [JDK 1.7](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BySF5BE_8udeZ0xCZGpQZkRSSGM)
  2. [MySQL 5.0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BySF5BE_8udeQk03N3liNTRWWDA)
  3. SQLyog 5.19 [Free Trail can be downloaded here](https://www.webyog.com/product/sqlyog_trialregform).
  As an alternative [MySQL WorkBench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) can also be downloaded and used. 
  4. [Eclipse-Indigo 3.7](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BySF5BE_8udeNWRCalVON0NUWjQ)
  5. [ApacheTomcat 6.0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BySF5BE_8udeeTJuTWllWXE1WlU)
  6. [HADOOP Softwares-x86-0.18.0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BySF5BE_8udeQUZlVV9IYlNmU1E)

This code has been run with Java 7; other versions may work, but have not been tested. The code factoring is also done for 32-bit Operating Systems but it as been found that the execution remains smooth for 64 bit systems also.
